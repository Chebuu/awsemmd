The AWSEM (Associated memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model) protein simulation code, based on a three-bead per amino-acid residue representation, has been written in C++ by Aram Davtyan, a graduate student in Professor Garegin Papoian's group at the University of Maryland. It is primarily based on the Associated Memory Hamiltonian (AMH) developed over many years by Professor Peter Wolynes and his group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of California in San Diego. The contact and water-mediated interactions were developed by Prof. Papoian, Dr. Ulander, and Prof. Wolynes in 2004, and the revised AMH was renamed AMW. The original AMH/AMW programs were written in Fortran by many people, including ..., Michael Eastwood, Michael Prentiss, Garegin Papoian, Johan Ulander, Chenghang Zong,...
